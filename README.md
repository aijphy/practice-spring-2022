A repository for practicing, mostly python.

In general, I wanted to practice challnges, so the 100-days-challenges follows along with the 100 Days of Code Udemy course. Some of the projects are directly solving the challenges, others I upgraded.

To learn about pytorch and practice machine learning, the pytorchTutorial directory follows the Deep Learning With PyTorch - Full Course by Python Engineer on YouTube.

I am also learning about APIs, so googleSearchforClimbingGym.py was my first time requesting from Google's search API.
